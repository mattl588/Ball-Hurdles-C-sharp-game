# Ball-Hurdles-C-sharp-game
Rudimentary c# visual game I wrote to get familiar with basic OOP. 

Not designed to be taken seriously. Upon playing, you'll immediately notice how terrible the graphics are.
Regardless, I learned a decent bit more about OOP from this project and got my first introduction to visual programming and interacting with the screen. This program was done in C#
and I used .cs and .xaml file formats to write the game through WPF.
